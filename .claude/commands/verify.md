Run `bash hack/verify.sh all` and analyze the output. For each failing check:
1. Identify which task it corresponds to
2. Read the task spec from TASKS.md
3. Diagnose what's wrong (run the verify command individually to see error output)
4. Fix the issue
5. Re-run the verification to confirm the fix
